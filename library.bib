abstract = {Heterodimeric integrin adhesion receptors regulate cell migration, survival and differentiation in metazoa by communicating signals bi-directionally across the plasma membrane. Protein engineering and mutagenesis studies have suggested that the dissociation of a complex formed by the single-pass transmembrane (TM) segments of the $\alpha$ and Β subunits is central to these signalling events. Here, we report the structure of the integrin $\alpha$IIbΒ3 TM complex, structure-based site-directed mutagenesis and lipid embedding estimates to reveal the structural event that underlies the transition from associated to dissociated states, that is, TM signalling. The complex is stabilized by glycine-packing mediated TM helix crossing within the extracellular membrane leaflet, and by unique hydrophobic and electrostatic bridges in the intracellular leaflet that mediate an unusual, asymmetric association of the 24- and 29-residue $\alpha$IIb and Β3 TM helices. The structurally unique, highly conserved integrin $\alpha$IIbΒ3 TM complex rationalizes bi-directional signalling and represents the first structure of a heterodimeric TM receptor complex.},

abstract = {The plasma membrane has a highly asymmetric distribution of lipids and contains dynamic nanodomains many of which are liquid entities surrounded by a second, slightly different, liquid environment. Contributing to the dynamics is a continuous repartitioning of components between the two types of liquids and transient links between lipids and proteins, both to extracellular matrix and cytoplasmic components, that temporarily pin membrane constituents. This make plasma membrane nanodomains exceptionally challenging to study and much of what is known about membrane domains has been deduced from studies on model membranes at equilibrium. However, living cells are by definition not at equilibrium and lipids are distributed asymmetrically with inositol phospholipids, phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidylserines confined mostly to the inner leaflet and glyco- and sphingolipids to the outer leaflet. Moreover, each phospholipid group encompasses a wealth of species with different acyl chain combinations whose lateral distribution is heterogeneous. It is becoming increasingly clear that asymmetry and pinning play important roles in plasma membrane nanodomain formation and coupling between the two lipid monolayers. How asymmetry, pinning, and interdigitation contribute to the plasma membrane organization is only beginning to be unraveled and here we discuss their roles and interdependence.},

abstract = {Interaction between transmembrane helices often determines biological activity of membrane proteins. Bitopic proteins, a broad subclass of membrane proteins, form dimers containing two membrane-spanning helices. Some aspects of their structure-function relationship cannot be fully understood without considering the protein-lipid interaction, which can determine the protein conformational ensemble. Experimental and computer modeling data concerning transmembrane parts of bitopic proteins are reviewed in the present paper. They highlight the importance of lipid-protein interactions and resolve certain paradoxes in the behavior of such proteins. Besides, some properties of membrane organization provided a clue to understanding of allosteric interactions between distant parts of proteins. Interactions of these kinds appear to underlie a signaling mechanism, which could be widely employed in the functioning of many membrane proteins. Treatment of membrane proteins as parts of integrated fine-tuned proteolipid system promises new insights into biological function mechanisms and approaches to drug design.

abstract = {Cell surface receptors of the integrin family are pivotal to cell adhesion and migration. The activation state of heterodimeric $\alpha$$\beta$ integrins is correlated to the association state of the single-pass $\alpha$ and $\beta$ transmembrane domains. The association of integrin $\alpha$iib$\beta$3 transmembrane domains, resulting in an inactive receptor, is characterized by the asymmetric arrangement of a straight ($\alpha$IIb) and tilted ($\beta$3) helix relative to the membrane in congruence to the dissociated structures. This allows for a continuous association interface centered on helix-helix glycine-packing and an unusual $\alpha$IIb(GFF) structural motif that packs the conserved phe-phe residues against the $\beta$3 transmembrane helix, enabling $\alpha$IIb(D723)$\beta$3(R995) electrostatic interactions. The transmembrane complex is further stabilized by the inactive ectodomain, thereby coupling its association state to the ectodomain conformation. in combination with recently determined structures of an inactive integrin ectodomain and an activating talin/$\beta$ complex that overlap with the $\alpha$$\beta$ transmembrane complex, a comprehensive picture of integrin bi-directional transmembrane signaling has emerged. {\textcopyright} 2010 Landes Bioscience.},

abstract = {Integrins are large cell-surface adhesion receptors that can be activated to a high affinity state by the formation of an intracellular complex between the integrin $\beta$-subunit tail, the membrane, and talin. The F2 and F3 subdomains of the talin head play a key role in formation of this complex. Here, activation of the integrin $\alpha$IIb/$\beta$3 dimer by the talin head domain was probed using multiscale molecular dynamics simulations. A number of novel insights emerge from these studies, including (i) the importance of the integrin $\alpha$IIb subunit F992 and F993 residues in stabilizing the "off" state of the $\alpha$IIb/$\beta$3 dimer, (ii) a crucial role for negatively charged groups in the F2-F3/membrane interaction, (iii) binding of the talin F2-F3 domain to negatively charged lipid headgroups in the membrane induces a reorientation of the $\beta$ transmembrane (TM) domain, (iv) an increase in the tilt angle of the $\beta$ TM domain relative to the bilayer normal helps to destabilize the $\alpha$/$\beta$ TM interaction and promote a scissor-like movement of the integrin TM helices. These results, combined with various published experimental observations, suggest a model for the mechanism of inside-out activation of integrins by talin.},

abstract = {Integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 is a member of the integrin family of transmembrane proteins present on the plasma membrane of platelets. Integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 is widely known to regulate the process of thrombosis via activation at its cytoplasmic side by talin and interaction with the soluble fibrinogen. It is also reported that three groups of interactions restrain integrin family members in the inactive state, including a set of salt bridges on the cytoplasmic side of the transmembrane domain of the integrin $\alpha$- and $\beta$-subunits known as the inner membrane clasp, hydrophobic packing of a few transmembrane residues on the extracellular side between the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-subunits that is known as the outer membrane clasp, and the key interaction group of the $\beta$A domain (located on the $\beta$-subunit head domain) with the $\beta$TD (proximal to the plasma membrane on the $\beta$-subunit). However, molecular details of this key interaction group as well as events that lead to detachment of the $\beta$TD and $\beta$A domains have remained ambiguous. In this study, we use molecular dynamics models to take a comprehensive outside-in and inside-out approach at exploring how integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 is activated. First, we show that talin's interaction with the membrane-proximal and membrane-distal regions of integrin cytoplasmic- transmembrane domains significantly loosens the inner membrane clasp. Talin also interacts with an additional salt bridge (R734-E1006), which facilitates integrin activation through the separation of the integrin's $\alpha$- and $\beta$-subunits. The second part of our study classifies three types of interactions between RGD peptides and the extracellular domains of integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3. Finally, we show that the interaction of the Arg of the RGD sequence may activate integrin via disrupting the key interaction group between K350 on the $\beta$A domain and S673/S674 on the $\beta$TD. {\textcopyright} 2013 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Gramicidin A (gA) is a 15-amino-acid antibiotic peptide with an alternating L-D sequence, which forms (dimeric) bilayer-spanning, monovalent cation channels in biological membranes and synthetic bilayers. We performed molecular dynamics simulations of gA dimers and monomers in all-atom, explicit dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC), dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayers. The variation in acyl chain length among these different phospholipids provides a way to alter gA-bilayer interactions by varying the bilayer hydrophobic thickness, and to determine the influence of hydrophobic mismatch on the structure and dynamics of both gA channels (and monomeric subunits) and the host bilayers. The simulations show that the channel structure varied little with changes in hydrophobic mismatch, and that the lipid bilayer adapts to the bilayer-spanning channel to minimize the exposure of hydrophobic residues. The bilayer thickness, however, did not vary monotonically as a function of radial distance from the channel. In all simulations, there was an initial decrease in thickness within 4-5 from the channel, which was followed by an increase in DOPC and POPC or a further decrease in DLPC and DMPC bilayers. The bilayer thickness varied little in the monomer simulations - except one of three independent simulations for DMPC and all three DLPC simulations, where the bilayer thinned to allow a single subunit to form a bilayer-spanning water-permeable pore. The radial dependence of local lipid area and bilayer compressibility is also nonmonotonic in the first shell around gA dimers due to gA-phospholipid interactions and the hydrophobic mismatch. Order parameters, acyl chain dynamics, and diffusion constants also differ between the lipids in the first shell and the bulk. The lipid behaviors in the first shell around gA dimers are more complex than predicted from a simple mismatch model, which has implications for understanding the energetics of membrane protein-lipid interactions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {The short cytoplasmic tails regulate activation of integrin adhesion receptors via clasping/unclasping of their membrane-proximal helices. Using integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 as a model, we show that a previously reported activating mutation $\alpha$IIb(R995D) that perturbs the electrostatic interface in the clasp only partially activates $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 and that extensive activation of the receptor is achieved by complete deletion of $\alpha$IIb CT or triple mutations in $\alpha$IIb(V990 A/F992A/R 995D) that disrupt both electrostatic and hydrophobic interfaces in the clasp. The results provide quantitative evidence for an equilibrium-based integrin activation process where shifting the equilibrium to the fully activated state requires total unclasping of the cytoplasmic tails. We further demonstrate that while the C-terminal region of the $\alpha$IIb tail minimally influences $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 activation, the C-terminal region of the $\beta$3 tail is critically involved. A disease-causing mutation of S752P in this region, but not S 752A, suppressed partial activation induced by R995D or the talin head domain but did not affect activation induced by $\alpha$IIb truncation. NMR spectroscopy revealed that S 752P but not the S752A mutation disrupted a C-terminal helix within the $\beta$3 tail, suggesting that the C-terminal helix may regulate the equilibrium-based clasping/unclasping process. Together, these data provide molecular insights into how distinct regions of the cytoplasmic tails differentially and cooperatively regulate integrin activation. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Single-pass membrane receptors contain extracellular domains that respond to external stimuli and transmit information to intracellular domains through a single transmembrane (TM) $\alpha$-helix. Because membrane receptors have various roles in homeostasis, signaling malfunctions of these receptors can cause disease. Despite their importance, there is still much to be understood mechanistically about how single-pass receptors are activated. In general, single-pass receptors respond to extracellular stimuli via alterations in their oligomeric state. The details of this process are still the focus of intense study, and several lines of evidence indicate that the TM domain (TMD) of the receptor plays a central role. We discuss three major mechanistic hypotheses for receptor activation: ligand-induced dimerization, ligand-induced rotation, and receptor clustering. Recent observations suggest that receptors can use a combination of these activation mechanisms and that technical limitations can bias interpretation. Short peptides derived from receptor TMDs, which can be identified by screening or rationally developed on the basis of the structure or sequence of their targets, have provided critical insights into receptor function. Here, we explore recent evidence that, depending on the target receptor, TMD peptides cannot only inhibit but also activate target receptors and can accommodate novel, bifunctional designs. Furthermore, we call for more sharing of negative results to inform the TMD peptide field, which is rapidly transforming into a suite of unique tools with the potential for future therapeutics.},

abstract = {Cells can sense and respond to various mechanical stimuli from their surrounding environment. One of the explanations for mechanosensitivity, a lipid-bilayer model, suggests that a stretch of the membrane induced by mechanical force alters the physical state of the lipid bilayer, driving mechanosensors to assume conformations better matched to the altered membrane. However, mechanosensors of this class are restricted to ion channels. Here, we reveal that integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3, a prototypic adhesion receptor, can be activated by various mechanical stimuli including stretch, shear stress, and osmotic pressure. The force-induced integrin activation was not dependent on its known intracellular activation signaling events and was even observed in reconstituted cell-free liposomes. Instead, these mechanical stimuli were found to alter the lipid embedding of the integrin $\beta$3 transmembrane domain (TMD) and subsequently weaken the $\alpha$IIb-$\beta$3 TMD interaction, which results in activation of the receptor. Moreover, artificial modulation of the membrane curvature near integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 can induce its activation in cells as well as in lipid nanodiscs, suggesting that physical deformation of the lipid bilayer, either by mechanical force or curvature, can induce integrin activation. Thus, our results establish the adhesion receptor as a bona fide mechanosensor that directly senses and responds to the force-modulated lipid environment. Furthermore, this study expands the lipid-bilayer model by suggesting that the force-induced topological change of TMDs and subsequent alteration in the TMD interactome is a molecular basis of sensing mechanical force transmitted via the lipid bilayer.},

abstract = {Recombinant proteins are important therapeutics due to potent, highly specific, and nontoxic actions in vivo. However, they are expensive medicines to manufacture, chemically unstable, and difficult to administer with low patient uptake and compliance. Small molecule drugs are cheaper and more bioavailable, but less target-specific in vivo and often have associated side effects. Here we combine some advantages of proteins and small molecules by taking short amino acid sequences that confer potency and selectivity to proteins, and fixing them as small constrained molecules that are chemically and structurally stable and easy to make. Proteins often use short $\alpha$-helices of just 1-4 helical turns (4-15 amino acids) to interact with biological targets, but peptides this short usually have negligible $\alpha$-helicity in water. Here we show that short peptides, corresponding to helical epitopes from viral, bacterial, or human proteins, can be strategically fixed in highly $\alpha$-helical structures in water. These helix-constrained compounds have similar biological potencies as proteins that bear the same helical sequences. Examples are (i) a picomolar inhibitor of Respiratory Syncytial Virus F protein mediated fusion with host cells, (ii) a nanomolar inhibitor of RNA binding to the transporter protein HIV-Rev, (iii) a submicromolar inhibitor of Streptococcus pneumoniae growth induced by quorum sensing pheromone Competence Stimulating Peptide, and (iv) a picomolar agonist of the GPCR pain receptor opioid receptor like receptor ORL-1.

abstract = {Cytoplasmic face-mediated integrin inside-out activation remains a paradigm in transmembrane signal transduction. Emerging evidence suggests that this process involves dissociation of the complex between the integrin cytoplasmic tails; however, a dynamic image of how it occurs on the membrane surface remains elusive. We show here that, whereas membrane-proximal helices of integrin $\alpha$/$\beta$ cytoplasmic tails associate in cytoplasm-like aqueous medium, they become partially embedded into membrane-mimetic micelles when unclasped. Membrane embedding induces substantial structural changes of the cytoplasmic tails as compared to their aqueous conformations and suggests there may be an upward movement of the membrane-proximal helices into the membrane during their separation. We further demonstrate that the $\beta$3 tail exhibits additional membrane binding site at its C terminus containing the NPLY motif. Talin, a key intracellular integrin activator, recognizes this site as well as the membrane-proximal helix, thereby promoting cytoplasmic tail separation along the membrane surface. These data provide a structural basis of membrane-mediated changes at the cytoplasmic face in regulating integrin activation and signaling.},

abstract = {The chemobiomechanical signatures of diseased cells are often distinctively different from that of healthy cells. This mainly arises from cellular structural/compositional alterations induced by disease development or therapeutic molecules. Therapeutic shock waves have the potential to mechanically destroy diseased cells and/or increase cell membrane permeability for drug delivery. However, the biomolecular mechanisms by which shock waves interact with diseased and healthy cellular components remain largely unknown. By integrating atomistic simulations with a novel multiscale numerical framework, this work provides new biomolecular mechanistic perspectives through which many mechanosensitive cellular processes could be quantitatively characterised. Here we examine the biomechanical responses of the chosen representative membrane complexes under rapid mechanical loadings pertinent to therapeutic shock wave conditions. We find that their rupture characteristics do not exhibit significant sensitivity to the applied strain rates. Furthermore, we show that the embedded rigid inclusions markedly facilitate stretch-induced membrane disruptions while mechanically stiffening the associated complexes under the applied membrane stretches. Our results suggest that the presence of rigid molecules in cellular membranes could serve as "mechanical catalysts" to promote the mechanical destructions of the associated complexes, which, in concert with other biochemical/medical considerations, should provide beneficial information for future biomechanical-mediated therapeutics.},

abstract = {Heterodimeric integrin adhesion receptors regulate diverse biological processes including angiogenesis, thrombosis and wound healing. The transmembrane-cytoplasmic domains (TMCDs) of integrins play a critical role in controlling activation of these receptors via an inside-out signaling mechanism, but the precise structural basis remains elusive. Here, we present the solution structure of integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 TMCD heterodimer, which reveals a right-handed coiled-coil conformation with 2 helices intertwined throughout the transmembrane region. The helices extend into the cytoplasm and form a clasp that differs significantly from a recently published $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 TMCD structure. We show that while a point mutation in the clasp interface modestly activates $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3, additional mutations in the transmembrane interface have a synergistic effect, leading to extensive integrin activation. Detailed analyses and structural comparison with previous studies suggest that extensive integrin activation is a highly concerted conformational transition process, which involves transmembrane coiled-coil unwinding that is triggered by the membrane-mediated alteration and disengagement of the membrane-proximal clasp. Our results provide atomic insight into a type I transmembrane receptor heterocomplex and the mechanism of integrin inside-out transmembrane signaling.},

abstract = {The interactions between cells and their extracellular matrix (ECM) are critically important for homeostatic control of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Transmembrane integrin molecules facilitate the communication between ECM and the cell. Since the characterization of integrins in the late 1980s, there has been great advancement in understanding the function of integrins at different subcellular levels. However, the versatility in molecular pathways integrins are involved in, the high diversity in their interaction partners both outside and inside the cell as well as on the cell membrane and the short lifetime of events happening at the cell–ECM interface make it difficult to elucidate all the details regarding integrin function experimentally. To overcome the experimental challenges and advance the understanding of integrin biology, computational modeling tools have been used extensively. In this review, we summarize the computational models of integrin signaling while we explain the function of integrins at three main subcellular levels (outside the cell, cell membrane, cytosol). We also discuss how these computational modeling efforts can be helpful in other disciplines such as biomaterial design. As such, this review is a didactic modeling summary for biomaterial researchers interested in complementing their experimental work with computational tools or for seasoned computational scientists that would like to advance current in silico integrin models.},

abstract = {Integrins are a family of $\alpha$/$\beta$ heterodimeric membrane proteins, which mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. The molecular mechanisms by which integrins are activated and cluster are currently poorly understood. One hypothesis posits that the cytoplasmic tails of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits interact strongly with one another in a 1:1 interaction, and that this interaction is modulated in the course of the activation of $\alpha$∥b$\beta$3 [Hughes, P. E., et al. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 6571-6574]. To examine the structural basis for this interaction, protein fragments encompassing the transmembrane helix plus cytoplasmic tails of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits of $\alpha$∥b$\beta$3 were expressed and studied in phospholipid micelles at physiological salt concentrations. Analyses of these fragments by analytical ultracentrifugation, NMR, circular dichroism, and electrophoresis indicated that they had very little or no tendency to interact with one another. Instead, they formed homomeric interactions, with the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-fragments forming dimers and trimers, respectively. Thus, these regions of the protein structure may contribute to the clustering of integrins that accompanies cellular adhesion.},

abstract = {Talin binding to integrin $\beta$ tails increases ligand binding affinity (activation). Changes in $\beta$ transmembrane domain (TMD) topology that disrupt $\alpha$-$\beta$ TMD interactions are proposed to mediate integrin activation. In this paper, we used membrane-embedded integrin $\beta$3 TMDs bearing environmentally sensitive fluorophores at inner or outer membrane water interfaces to monitor talin-induced $\beta$3 TMD motion in model membranes. Talin binding to the $\beta$3 cytoplasmic domain increased amino acid side chain embedding at the inner and outer borders of the $\beta$3 TMD, indicating altered topology of the $\beta$3 TMD. Talin's capacity to effect this change depended on its ability to bind to both the integrin $\beta$ tail and the membrane. Introduction of a flexible hinge at the midpoint of the $\beta$3 TMD decoupled the talin-induced change in intracellular TMD topology from the extracellular side and blocked talin-induced activation of integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3. Thus, we show that talin binding to the integrin $\beta$ TMD alters the topology of the TMD, resulting in integrin activation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Kim et al.},

abstract = {Integrins are $\alpha$/$\beta$ heterodimeric transmembrane adhesion receptors. Evidence exists that their transmembrane domain (TMD) separates upon activation. Subunit-specific differences in activation sensitivity of integrins were reported. However, whether sequence variations in the TMD lead to differential TMD association has remained elusive. Here, we show by molecular dynamics simulations and association free energy calculations on TMDs of integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3, $\alpha$v$\beta$3, and $\alpha$5$\beta$1 that $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 TMD is most stably associated; this difference is related to interaction differences across the TMDs. The order of TMD association stability is paralleled by the basal activity of these integrins, which suggests that TMD differences can have a decisive effect on integrin conformational free energies. We also identified a specific order of clasp disintegration upon TMD dissociation, which suggests that the closed state of integrins may comprise several microstates. Our results provide unprecedented insights into a possibly contributing role of TMD towards subunit-specific sensitivity of integrin activation.},

Monolayers of DPPC, DMPS and their mixture DPPC:DMPS 87:13 mol{\%} were used as simple models of one leaflet of a cell membrane. The incorporation of cubosomes into the lipid layers spread at the air-water interface was followed by surface-pressure measurements and Brewster angle microscopy. The cubosome - membrane interactions lead to the fluidization of the model membranes but this effect depended on the composition of the model membrane and on the type of cubosomes. The interactions of PT cubosomes with lipid layers, especially DMPS-based monolayer were stronger compared with those of GMO-based nanoparticles. The kinetics of incorporation of cubosomal material into the lipid layer was influenced by the extent of hydration of the polar headgroups of the lipid: faster in the case of smaller, less hydrated polar groups of DMPS than for strongly hydrated uncharged choline of DPPC. The membrane disrupting effect of cubosomes increased at longer times of the lipid membrane exposure to the cubosome solution and at larger carrier concentrations. Langmuir monolayer observations correspond well to results of studies of HeLa cells exposed to cubosomes. The larger toxicity of PT cubosomes was confirmed by MTS. Their ability to disrupt lipid membranes was imaged by confocal microscopy. On the other hand, PT cubosomes easily penetrated cellular membranes and released cargo into various cellular compartments more effectively than GMO-based nanocarriers. Therefore, at low concentrations, they may be further investigated as a promising drug delivery tool.},

abstract = {We quantify directly here for the first time the extents of interactions of two different anthracycline drugs with pure and mixed lipid monolayers with respect to the surface pressure and elucidate differences in the resulting interaction mechanisms. The work concerns interactions of doxorubicin (DOx) and idarubicin (IDA) with monolayers of the zwitterionic DMPC (1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and negatively charged DMPS (1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (sodium salt)) as well as a 7:3 mixture of the two lipids. These drugs are used in current cancer treatments, while the lipid systems were chosen as phosphocholines are the major lipid component of healthy cell membranes, and phosphoserines are the major lipid component that is externalized into the outer leaflet of cancerous cell membranes. It is shown that DOx interacts with DMPS monolayers to a greater extent than with DMPC monolayers by lower limits of a factor of 5 at a surface pressure of 10 mN/m and a factor of 12 at 30 mN/m. With increasing surface pressure, the small amount of drug ({\~{}}0.3 µmol/m2) bound to DMPC monolayers is excluded from the interface, yet its interaction with DMPS monolayers is enhanced until there is even more drug ({\~{}}3.2 µmol/m2) than lipid ({\~{}}2.6 µmol/m2) at the interface. Direct evidence is presented for all systems studied that upon surface area compression lipid is reproducibly expelled from the monolayer, which we infer to be in the form of drug-lipid aggregates, yet the nature of adsorption of material back to the monolayer upon expansion is system-dependent. At 30 mN/m, most relevant to human physiology, the interactions of DOx and IDA are starkly different. For DOx, there is a conformational change in the interfacial layer driven by aggregation, resulting in the formation of lateral domains that have extended layers of drug. For the more lipophilic IDA, there is penetration of the drug into the hydrophobic acyl chain region of the monolayer and no indication of lateral segregation. In addition to the Langmuir technique, these advances were made as a result of direct measurements of the interfacial composition, structure and morphology using two different implementations of neutron reflectometry and Brewster angle microscopy. The results provide new insight into key processes that determine the uptake of drugs such as limited drug penetration through cell membranes by passive diffusion as well as activation of drug removal mechanisms related to multidrug resistance.},

However, assessing integrin conformations is both experimentally and computationally challenging because of limitations in resolution and dynamic sampling. Thus, structural changes that underlie transitions between conformations are largely unknown. Here, focusing on integrin $\alpha$v$\beta$ 3 , we developed a modified form of the coarse-grained heterogeneous elastic network model (hENM), which allows sampling conformations at the onset of activation by formally separating local fluctuations from global motions. Both local fluctuations and global motions are extracted from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the full-length $\alpha$v$\beta$ 3 bent integrin conformer, but whereas the former are incorporated in the hENM as effective harmonic interactions between groups of residues, the latter emerge by systematically identifying and treating weak interactions between long-distance domains with flexible and anharmonic connections. The new hENM model allows integrins and single-point mutant integrins to explore various conformational states, including the initiation of separation between $\alpha$- and $\beta$-subunit cytoplasmic regions, headpiece extension, and legs opening.},

A turn at the Gly of the juxtamembrane GFFKR motif caps the $\alpha$ TM helix and brings the two Phe of GFFKR into the $\alpha$/$\beta$ interface.

abstract = {Integrins are heterodimeric ($\alpha$$\beta$) cell surface receptors that are activated to a high affinity state by the formation of a complex involving the $\alpha$/$\beta$ integrin transmembrane helix dimer, the head domain of talin (a cytoplasmic protein that links integrins to actin), and the membrane. The talin head domain contains four sub-domains (F0, F1, F2 and F3) with a long cationic loop inserted in the F1 domain. Here, we model the binding and interactions of the complete talin head domain with a phospholipid bilayer, using multiscale molecular dynamics simulations. The role of the inserted F1 loop, which is missing from the crystal structure of the talin head, PDB:3IVF, is explored. The results show that the talin head domain binds to the membrane predominantly via cationic regions on the F2 and F3 subdomains and the F1 loop. Upon binding, the intact talin head adopts a novel V-shaped conformation which optimizes its interactions with the membrane. Simulations of the complex of talin with the integrin $\alpha$/$\beta$ TM helix dimer in a membrane, show how this complex promotes a rearrangement, and eventual dissociation of, the integrin $\alpha$ and $\beta$ transmembrane helices. A model for the talin-mediated integrin activation is proposed which describes how the mutual interplay of interactions between transmembrane helices, the cytoplasmic talin protein, and the lipid bilayer promotes integrin inside-out activation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Kalli et al.},

Membrane proteins have proven to be difficult to study owing to their partially hydrophobic surfaces, flexibility and lack of stability. The field is now taking advantage of the high-throughput revolution in structural biology and methods are emerging for effective expression, solubilisation, purification and crystallisation of membrane proteins.

abstract = {Structures of intact receptors with single-pass transmembrane domains are essential to understand how extracellular and cytoplasmic domains regulate association and signaling through transmembrane domains. A chemical and computational method to determine structures of the membrane regions of such receptors on the cell surface is developed here and validated with glycophorin A. An integrin heterodimer structure reveals association over most of the lengths of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ transmembrane domains and shows that the principles governing association of hetero and homo transmembrane dimers differ. A turn at the Gly of the juxtamembrane GFFKR motif caps the $\alpha$ TM helix and brings the two Phe of GFFKR into the $\alpha$/$\beta$ interface. A juxtamembrane Lys residue in $\beta$ also has an important role in the interface. The structure shows how transmembrane association/dissociation regulates integrin signaling. A joint ectodomain and membrane structure shows that substantial flexibility between the extracellular and TM domains is compatible with TM signaling. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Integrins are $\alpha$/$\beta$ heterodimeric transmembrane adhesion receptors. Evidence exists that their transmembrane domain (TMD) separates upon activation. Subunit-specific differences in activation sensitivity of integrins were reported. However, whether sequence variations in the TMD lead to differential TMD association has remained elusive. Here, we show by molecular dynamics simulations and association free energy calculations on TMDs of integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3, $\alpha$v$\beta$3, and $\alpha$5$\beta$1 that $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 TMD is most stably associated; this difference is related to interaction differences across the TMDs. The order of TMD association stability is paralleled by the basal activity of these integrins, which suggests that TMD differences can have a decisive effect on integrin conformational free energies. We also identified a specific order of clasp disintegration upon TMD dissociation, which suggests that the closed state of integrins may comprise several microstates. Our results provide unprecedented insights into a possibly contributing role of TMD towards subunit-specific sensitivity of integrin activation.},

abstract = {In this report we describe a general survey of all helices found in 57 of the known protein crystal structures, together with a detailed analysis of 48 $\alpha$-helices found in 16 of the structures that are determined to high resolution. The survey of all helices reveals a total of 291 $\alpha$-helices, 71 310-helices and no examples of $\pi$-helices. The conformations of the observed helices are significantly different from the "ideal" linear structures. The mean $\phi$, $\psi$ angles for the $\alpha$- and 310-helices found in proteins are, respectively, (-62 °, -41 °) and (-71 °, -18 °). A computer program, HBEND, is used to characterize and to quantify the different types of helix distortion. $\alpha$-Helices are classified as regular or irregular, linear, curved or kinked. Of the 48 $\alpha$-helices analysed, only 15{\%} are considered to be linear; 17{\%} are kinked, and 58{\%} are curved. The curvature of helices is caused by differences in the peptide hydrogen bonding on opposite faces of the helix, reflecting carbonyl-solvent/side-chain interactions for the exposed residues, and packing constraints for residues involved in the hydrophobic core. Kinked helices arise either as a result of included proline residues, or because of conflicting requirements for the optimal packing of the helix side-chains. In $\alpha$-helices where there are kinks caused by proline residues, we show that the angle of kink is relatively constant ({\~{}}26 °), and that there is minimal disruption of the helix hydrogen bonding. The proline residues responsible for the kinks are highly conserved, suggesting that these distortions may be structurally/functionally important. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {Myristoylated proteins typically develop a tight association with membranes. One example is the matrix domain (MA) of the HIV-1 Gag protein. In addition, MA is able to bind the Sel25 RNA sequence, a ligand that can act as a competitor for the interaction with the membrane. These properties make HIV-1 MA an attractive molecule to understand how protein and peptide surface properties can be controlled by myristoylation and oligonucleotide interaction. In this line, we analyzed the stability, thermodynamics, and the topography of Langmuir monolayers composed of the myristoylated or unmyristoylated versions of MA in the presence or the absence of a single-strand DNA (ssDNASel25) analogue of the Sel25 RNA sequence. With a similar approach, we compared the MA surface properties with those obtained from monolayers of myristoylated and unmyristoylated MA-derived peptides (first 21 residues of the MA sequence). Our results show that the protein or peptide films are destabilized by the presence of ssDNASel25, inducing solubilization of the monolayer components into the bulk phase. In addition, the oligonucleotide affects the protein-protein or peptide-peptide lateral interactions, provoking interfacial topography changes of the monolayers, visualized by Brewster angle microscopy. Furthermore, we also show how the myristoyl group has major effects on the lateral stability and the elasticity of the monolayers. Altogether, here we propose a general model considering the effect of myristoylation and the interaction with oligonucleotides on the interfacial properties of MA and derived peptides. In this model, we introduce a new role of the core region of MA (sequence of MA after the 21st residue) that confers higher lateral interfacial stability to the protein.},

abstract = {The plasma membrane has a highly asymmetric distribution of lipids and contains dynamic nanodomains many of which are liquid entities surrounded by a second, slightly different, liquid environment. Contributing to the dynamics is a continuous repartitioning of components between the two types of liquids and transient links between lipids and proteins, both to extracellular matrix and cytoplasmic components, that temporarily pin membrane constituents. This make plasma membrane nanodomains exceptionally challenging to study and much of what is known about membrane domains has been deduced from studies on model membranes at equilibrium. However, living cells are by definition not at equilibrium and lipids are distributed asymmetrically with inositol phospholipids, phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidylserines confined mostly to the inner leaflet and glyco- and sphingolipids to the outer leaflet. Moreover, each phospholipid group encompasses a wealth of species with different acyl chain combinations whose lateral distribution is heterogeneous. It is becoming increasingly clear that asymmetry and pinning play important roles in plasma membrane nanodomain formation and coupling between the two lipid monolayers. How asymmetry, pinning, and interdigitation contribute to the plasma membrane organization is only beginning to be unraveled and here we discuss their roles and interdependence.},

abstract = {Integrins are heterodimeric ($\alpha$$\beta$) cell surface receptors that are activated to a high affinity state by the formation of a complex involving the $\alpha$/$\beta$ integrin transmembrane helix dimer, the head domain of talin (a cytoplasmic protein that links integrins to actin), and the membrane. The talin head domain contains four sub-domains (F0, F1, F2 and F3) with a long cationic loop inserted in the F1 domain. Here, we model the binding and interactions of the complete talin head domain with a phospholipid bilayer, using multiscale molecular dynamics simulations. The role of the inserted F1 loop, which is missing from the crystal structure of the talin head, PDB:3IVF, is explored. The results show that the talin head domain binds to the membrane predominantly via cationic regions on the F2 and F3 subdomains and the F1 loop. Upon binding, the intact talin head adopts a novel V-shaped conformation which optimizes its interactions with the membrane. Simulations of the complex of talin with the integrin $\alpha$/$\beta$ TM helix dimer in a membrane, show how this complex promotes a rearrangement, and eventual dissociation of, the integrin $\alpha$ and $\beta$ transmembrane helices. A model for the talin-mediated integrin activation is proposed which describes how the mutual interplay of interactions between transmembrane helices, the cytoplasmic talin protein, and the lipid bilayer promotes integrin inside-out activation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Kalli et al.},

Monolayers of DPPC, DMPS and their mixture DPPC:DMPS 87:13 mol{\%} were used as simple models of one leaflet of a cell membrane. The incorporation of cubosomes into the lipid layers spread at the air-water interface was followed by surface-pressure measurements and Brewster angle microscopy. The cubosome - membrane interactions lead to the fluidization of the model membranes but this effect depended on the composition of the model membrane and on the type of cubosomes. The interactions of PT cubosomes with lipid layers, especially DMPS-based monolayer were stronger compared with those of GMO-based nanoparticles. The kinetics of incorporation of cubosomal material into the lipid layer was influenced by the extent of hydration of the polar headgroups of the lipid: faster in the case of smaller, less hydrated polar groups of DMPS than for strongly hydrated uncharged choline of DPPC. The membrane disrupting effect of cubosomes increased at longer times of the lipid membrane exposure to the cubosome solution and at larger carrier concentrations. Langmuir monolayer observations correspond well to results of studies of HeLa cells exposed to cubosomes. The larger toxicity of PT cubosomes was confirmed by MTS. Their ability to disrupt lipid membranes was imaged by confocal microscopy. On the other hand, PT cubosomes easily penetrated cellular membranes and released cargo into various cellular compartments more effectively than GMO-based nanocarriers. Therefore, at low concentrations, they may be further investigated as a promising drug delivery tool.},

(1993) Biochemistry 32, 11696–11703]. Here, we show that acyl structure is a key parameter controlling GalCer's ability to interact with cholesterol. Different chain-pure GalCer species containing saturated (24:0, 18:0, or 10:0), or unsaturated (24:1$\Delta$15, 22:1$\Delta$13, or 18:2$\Delta$9,12) acyl chains were synthesized. After measurement of the force-area behavior of mixed cholesterol/GalCer films at 24 °C, the average molecular area and average compressibility were determined as a function of film composition. Cholesterol exerts only a slight condensing effect when the GalCer species are liquid-ordered [liquid-condensed], with maximum condensation occurring near 0.25 mole fraction. However, cholesterol exerts a marked condensing effect on liquid-disordered (liquid-expanded) GalCer species regardless of whether the acyl chain is saturated or unsaturated. Maximum condensation occurs at cholesterol mole fractions between 0.3 and 0.4. We also compared cholesterol's relative condensing effect on liquid-expanded GalCer versus sphingomyelin. Cholesterol's condensation of either bovine brain or egg sphingomyelin is 25–30{\%} greater than that observed with different liquid-expanded GalCer species. Aside from average area behavior, we assessed cholesterol's interfacial interactions with the various sphingolipids by determining the average compressibility as a function of composition. The compressibility of condensed GalCer derivatives changes very little upon addition of cholesterol. In contrast, cholesterol causes dramatic changes when combined with liquid-expanded GalCer derivatives, which all have compressibilities 4–5-fold higher than bovine brain GalCer. The nature of the cholesterol-induced change in average compressibility for liquid-expanded GalCer derivatives depends on acyl structure and surface pressure. {\textcopyright} 1994, American Chemical Society.

Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and circular dichroism (CD) experimental data suggested that aurein 2.3 exists in solution as unstructured monomers and folds to form predominantly $\alpha$-helical structures in the presence of a dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine membrane. MD showed that the peptide was highly surface active, which supported monolayer data where the peptide induced surface pressure changes {\textgreater} 34 mN m - 1. In the presence of a lipid membrane MD simulations suggested that under hydrophobic mismatch the peptide is seen to insert via oblique orientation with a phenylalanine residue (PHE3) playing a key role in the membrane interaction.

abstract = {The short cytoplasmic tails regulate activation of integrin adhesion receptors via clasping/unclasping of their membrane-proximal helices. Using integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 as a model, we show that a previously reported activating mutation $\alpha$IIb(R995D) that perturbs the electrostatic interface in the clasp only partially activates $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 and that extensive activation of the receptor is achieved by complete deletion of $\alpha$IIb CT or triple mutations in $\alpha$IIb(V990 A/F992A/R 995D) that disrupt both electrostatic and hydrophobic interfaces in the clasp. The results provide quantitative evidence for an equilibrium-based integrin activation process where shifting the equilibrium to the fully activated state requires total unclasping of the cytoplasmic tails. We further demonstrate that while the C-terminal region of the $\alpha$IIb tail minimally influences $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 activation, the C-terminal region of the $\beta$3 tail is critically involved. A disease-causing mutation of S752P in this region, but not S 752A, suppressed partial activation induced by R995D or the talin head domain but did not affect activation induced by $\alpha$IIb truncation. NMR spectroscopy revealed that S 752P but not the S752A mutation disrupted a C-terminal helix within the $\beta$3 tail, suggesting that the C-terminal helix may regulate the equilibrium-based clasping/unclasping process. Together, these data provide molecular insights into how distinct regions of the cytoplasmic tails differentially and cooperatively regulate integrin activation. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Integrin conformational dynamics are critical to their receptor and signaling functions in many cellular processes, including spreading, adhesion, and migration. However, assessing integrin conformations is both experimentally and computationally challenging because of limitations in resolution and dynamic sampling. Thus, structural changes that underlie transitions between conformations are largely unknown. Here, focusing on integrin $\alpha$v$\beta$ 3 , we developed a modified form of the coarse-grained heterogeneous elastic network model (hENM), which allows sampling conformations at the onset of activation by formally separating local fluctuations from global motions. Both local fluctuations and global motions are extracted from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the full-length $\alpha$v$\beta$ 3 bent integrin conformer, but whereas the former are incorporated in the hENM as effective harmonic interactions between groups of residues, the latter emerge by systematically identifying and treating weak interactions between long-distance domains with flexible and anharmonic connections. The new hENM model allows integrins and single-point mutant integrins to explore various conformational states, including the initiation of separation between $\alpha$- and $\beta$-subunit cytoplasmic regions, headpiece extension, and legs opening.},

abstract = {HIV-1 assembly occurs at the plasma membrane, with the Gag polyprotein playing a crucial role. Gag association with the membrane is directed by the matrix domain (MA), which is myristoylated and has a highly basic region that interacts with anionic lipids. Several pieces of evidence suggest that the presence of phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) highly influences this binding. Furthermore, MA also interacts with nucleic acids, which is proposed to be important for the specificity of GAG for PIP2-containing membranes. It is hypothesized that RNA has a chaperone function by interacting with the MA domain, preventing Gag from associating with unspecific lipid interfaces. Here, we study the interaction of MA with monolayer and bilayer membrane systems, focusing on the specificity for PIP2 and on the possible effects of a Gag N-terminal peptide on impairing the binding for either RNA or membrane. We found that RNA decreases the kinetics of the protein association with lipid monolayers but has no effect on the selectivity for PIP2. Interestingly, for bilayer systems, this selectivity increases in presence of both the peptide and RNA, even for highly negatively charged compositions, where MA alone does not discriminate between membranes with or without PIP2. Therefore, we propose that the specificity of MA for PIP2-containing membranes might be related to the electrostatic properties of both membrane and protein local environments, rather than a simple difference in molecular affinities. This scenario provides a new understanding of the regulation mechanism, with a macromolecular view, rather than considering molecular interactions within a ligand-receptor model.},

abstract = {Heterodimeric integrin adhesion receptors regulate diverse biological processes including angiogenesis, thrombosis and wound healing. The transmembrane-cytoplasmic domains (TMCDs) of integrins play a critical role in controlling activation of these receptors via an inside-out signaling mechanism, but the precise structural basis remains elusive. Here, we present the solution structure of integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 TMCD heterodimer, which reveals a right-handed coiled-coil conformation with 2 helices intertwined throughout the transmembrane region. The helices extend into the cytoplasm and form a clasp that differs significantly from a recently published $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 TMCD structure. We show that while a point mutation in the clasp interface modestly activates $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3, additional mutations in the transmembrane interface have a synergistic effect, leading to extensive integrin activation. Detailed analyses and structural comparison with previous studies suggest that extensive integrin activation is a highly concerted conformational transition process, which involves transmembrane coiled-coil unwinding that is triggered by the membrane-mediated alteration and disengagement of the membrane-proximal clasp. Our results provide atomic insight into a type I transmembrane receptor heterocomplex and the mechanism of integrin inside-out transmembrane signaling.},

abstract = {Talin binding to integrin $\beta$ tails increases ligand binding affinity (activation). Changes in $\beta$ transmembrane domain (TMD) topology that disrupt $\alpha$-$\beta$ TMD interactions are proposed to mediate integrin activation. In this paper, we used membrane-embedded integrin $\beta$3 TMDs bearing environmentally sensitive fluorophores at inner or outer membrane water interfaces to monitor talin-induced $\beta$3 TMD motion in model membranes. Talin binding to the $\beta$3 cytoplasmic domain increased amino acid side chain embedding at the inner and outer borders of the $\beta$3 TMD, indicating altered topology of the $\beta$3 TMD. Talin's capacity to effect this change depended on its ability to bind to both the integrin $\beta$ tail and the membrane. Introduction of a flexible hinge at the midpoint of the $\beta$3 TMD decoupled the talin-induced change in intracellular TMD topology from the extracellular side and blocked talin-induced activation of integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3. Thus, we show that talin binding to the integrin $\beta$ TMD alters the topology of the TMD, resulting in integrin activation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Kim et al.},

However, in aqueous solution the dipole is counteracted by an electrostatic reaction field generated by the solvent, and the strength of the helix dipole may reduce drastically from its value in vacuum. Here, using atomic-detail helix models and Poisson-Boltzmann continuum electrostatics calculations, the net effective dipole moment, $\mu$eff, is calculated. Some initially surprising results are found. Whereas in vacuum $\mu$eff increases with helix length, the opposite is found to be the case for transmembrane helices. In soluble proteins, $\mu$eff is found to vary strongly with the orientation and position of the helix relative to the aqueous medium. A set of rules is established to estimate of the strength of $\mu$eff from graphical inspection of protein structures. {\textcopyright}2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

They all share the common property of interacting with the cellular lipid membrane in their mode of action. Therefore, a better understanding of the peptide/lipid (P/L) interaction is essential to help decipher their mechanism of action. Among the different biophysical methods that can be used to fully characterize P/L interactions, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) allows determining the peptide effect on the lipid phase transitions, a property that reflects the P/L interaction mode.

The activation state of heterodimeric $\alpha$$\beta$ integrins is correlated to the association state of the single-pass $\alpha$ and $\beta$ transmembrane domains. The association of integrin $\alpha$iib$\beta$3 transmembrane domains, resulting in an inactive receptor, is characterized by the asymmetric arrangement of a straight ($\alpha$IIb) and tilted ($\beta$3) helix relative to the membrane in congruence to the dissociated structures. This allows for a continuous association interface centered on helix-helix glycine-packing and an unusual $\alpha$IIb(GFF) structural motif that packs the conserved phe-phe residues against the $\beta$3 transmembrane helix, enabling $\alpha$IIb(D723)$\beta$3(R995) electrostatic interactions. The transmembrane complex is further stabilized by the inactive ectodomain, thereby coupling its association state to the ectodomain conformation. in combination with recently determined structures of an inactive integrin ectodomain and an activating talin/$\beta$ complex that overlap with the $\alpha$$\beta$ transmembrane complex, a comprehensive picture of integrin bi-directional transmembrane signaling has emerged. {\textcopyright} 2010 Landes Bioscience.},

Here, activation of the integrin $\alpha$IIb/$\beta$3 dimer by the talin head domain was probed using multiscale molecular dynamics simulations. A number of novel insights emerge from these studies, including (i) the importance of the integrin $\alpha$IIb subunit F992 and F993 residues in stabilizing the "off" state of the $\alpha$IIb/$\beta$3 dimer, (ii) a crucial role for negatively charged groups in the F2-F3/membrane interaction, (iii) binding of the talin F2-F3 domain to negatively charged lipid headgroups in the membrane induces a reorientation of the $\beta$ transmembrane (TM) domain, (iv) an increase in the tilt angle of the $\beta$ TM domain relative to the bilayer normal helps to destabilize the $\alpha$/$\beta$ TM interaction and promote a scissor-like movement of the integrin TM helices.

abstract = {To apply the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique as a platform for investigating the fundamental properties of amphiphilic peptides (APs), we have investigated the structure of LB films using the APs. To vertically orient the helical APs like transmembrane proteins in the membrane, the primary structure of the APs was designed to have two domains: a hydrophilic domain (three amino acids) and a hydrophobic domain (ca. 20 amino acids). However, we are still far from having full control of their orientation. This study reports the contribution of the subphase temperature to the change in the orientation of helical APs. When the surface pressure-area isotherm of AP was observed at the subphase temperature at 41.5 °C, the isotherm exhibited a plateau, implying that a phase transition of the monolayer at the air-water interface occurred. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the monolayers transferred on the solid substrates revealed that the orientation of the helices changed at the pressure, where the plateau of the isotherm was observed. This change was not observed at 21.5 °C, i.e., the horizontal alignment of helixes was maintained. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to systematically investigate the surface structure of the monolayers transferred at different surface pressures. A structural model of the monolayer that did not contradict with the results obtained by the three different techniques (the isotherm, CD spectroscopy, and AFM) was derived, and it was concluded that the horizontally oriented helices partially changed their orientation to vertical upon compression in the plateau region of the isotherm.},

abstract = {Cells can sense and respond to various mechanical stimuli from their surrounding environment. One of the explanations for mechanosensitivity, a lipid-bilayer model, suggests that a stretch of the membrane induced by mechanical force alters the physical state of the lipid bilayer, driving mechanosensors to assume conformations better matched to the altered membrane. However, mechanosensors of this class are restricted to ion channels. Here, we reveal that integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3, a prototypic adhesion receptor, can be activated by various mechanical stimuli including stretch, shear stress, and osmotic pressure. The force-induced integrin activation was not dependent on its known intracellular activation signaling events and was even observed in reconstituted cell-free liposomes. Instead, these mechanical stimuli were found to alter the lipid embedding of the integrin $\beta$3 transmembrane domain (TMD) and subsequently weaken the $\alpha$IIb-$\beta$3 TMD interaction, which results in activation of the receptor. Moreover, artificial modulation of the membrane curvature near integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 can induce its activation in cells as well as in lipid nanodiscs, suggesting that physical deformation of the lipid bilayer, either by mechanical force or curvature, can induce integrin activation. Thus, our results establish the adhesion receptor as a bona fide mechanosensor that directly senses and responds to the force-modulated lipid environment. Furthermore, this study expands the lipid-bilayer model by suggesting that the force-induced topological change of TMDs and subsequent alteration in the TMD interactome is a molecular basis of sensing mechanical force transmitted via the lipid bilayer.},

Upon compression, the effective dipole moments derived from the surface potentials of the PLGA-b-PMLGSLG monolayers decrease gradually, most likely as a result of the immersion of the hydrophilic block in water and cancellation of the interactions between the hydrophobic block and the underlying water molecules. The polypeptide macrodipole moment immersed in water was apparently effectively screened out. The remaining effective dipole moment of the monolayer contributes mainly to the hydrophobic block, and upon tilting away from the water surface toward the surface normal, it was found to increase with the hydrophobic block length, indicating the gradual formation of unidirectional aligned polypeptide molecules in the double-brush monolayer. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The structure of a protein can be analysed in terms of what may be called the "hydrophobic moments" of (1) the entire molecule and (2) of the segments of secondary structure that make up the polypeptide chain. The zeroth moment is defined as the sum of the hydrophobicities of the amino-acid residues of the structure under consideration; it is the analogue of the net charge of a cluster of point charges. The first moment, or hydrophobic dipole moment, is the analogue of the electric dipole moment of a cluster of charges. Just as the electric dipole moment measures the asymmetry of the charge distribution, the hydrophobic dipole moment measures the amphiphilicity (asymmetry of hydrophobicity) of the structure. A large hydrophobic dipole moment indicates that a structure is predominantly hydrophobic on one side and predominantly hydrophilic on the other. A quadrupole hydrophobic moment may be similarly defined. It indicates whether a protein is more hydrophobic in its interior (as for a globular protein in aqueous solution) or at its surface (as for a membrane protein). The hydrophobic dipole moment is useful in two separate applications. The first, which we have discussed elsewhere [D. Eisenberg, R. M. Weiss and T. C. Terwilliger, Nature (London), 1982, 299, 371] relates the function and secondary structure of a region of protein structure to its amino-acid sequence. For example, sequences that form surface-seeking helices have large hydrophobic dipole moments. The second application is in the analysis of interactions of a segment or domain of a protein with neighbouring regions in the protein and with other parts of the environment. In this paper we examine the hydrophobic dipole moments in the known structures of nine globular proteins and find that the moments of neighbouring segments tend to point towards each other. This suggests that the hydrophobic dipole can serve as a simple and pictorial summary of some of the forces at work in the folding of proteins. We have also found that the interactions of some macromolecules with an apolar-polar interface can be conveniently described in terms of the hydrophobic moments of the molecule and a "hydrophobic field" which reflects the hydrophobicity of the environment.},

This mainly arises from cellular structural/compositional alterations induced by disease development or therapeutic molecules. Therapeutic shock waves have the potential to mechanically destroy diseased cells and/or increase cell membrane permeability for drug delivery. However, the biomolecular mechanisms by which shock waves interact with diseased and healthy cellular components remain largely unknown. By integrating atomistic simulations with a novel multiscale numerical framework, this work provides new biomolecular mechanistic perspectives through which many mechanosensitive cellular processes could be quantitatively characterised. Here we examine the biomechanical responses of the chosen representative membrane complexes under rapid mechanical loadings pertinent to therapeutic shock wave conditions. We find that their rupture characteristics do not exhibit significant sensitivity to the applied strain rates. Furthermore, we show that the embedded rigid inclusions markedly facilitate stretch-induced membrane disruptions while mechanically stiffening the associated complexes under the applied membrane stretches. Our results suggest that the presence of rigid molecules in cellular membranes could serve as "mechanical catalysts" to promote the mechanical destructions of the associated complexes, which, in concert with other biochemical/medical considerations, should provide beneficial information for future biomechanical-mediated therapeutics.},

Bitopic proteins, a broad subclass of membrane proteins, form dimers containing two membrane-spanning helices. Some aspects of their structure-function relationship cannot be fully understood without considering the protein-lipid interaction, which can determine the protein conformational ensemble. Experimental and computer modeling data concerning transmembrane parts of bitopic proteins are reviewed in the present paper. They highlight the importance of lipid-protein interactions and resolve certain paradoxes in the behavior of such proteins. Besides, some properties of membrane organization provided a clue to understanding of allosteric interactions between distant parts of proteins. Interactions of these kinds appear to underlie a signaling mechanism, which could be widely employed in the functioning of many membrane proteins. Treatment of membrane proteins as parts of integrated fine-tuned proteolipid system promises new insights into biological function mechanisms and approaches to drug design.

Integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 is widely known to regulate the process of thrombosis via activation at its cytoplasmic side by talin and interaction with the soluble fibrinogen. It is also reported that three groups of interactions restrain integrin family members in the inactive state, including a set of salt bridges on the cytoplasmic side of the transmembrane domain of the integrin $\alpha$- and $\beta$-subunits known as the inner membrane clasp, hydrophobic packing of a few transmembrane residues on the extracellular side between the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-subunits that is known as the outer membrane clasp, and the key interaction group of the $\beta$A domain (located on the $\beta$-subunit head domain) with the $\beta$TD (proximal to the plasma membrane on the $\beta$-subunit). However, molecular details of this key interaction group as well as events that lead to detachment of the $\beta$TD and $\beta$A domains have remained ambiguous. In this study, we use molecular dynamics models to take a comprehensive outside-in and inside-out approach at exploring how integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 is activated. First, we show that talin's interaction with the membrane-proximal and membrane-distal regions of integrin cytoplasmic- transmembrane domains significantly loosens the inner membrane clasp. Talin also interacts with an additional salt bridge (R734-E1006), which facilitates integrin activation through the separation of the integrin's $\alpha$- and $\beta$-subunits. The second part of our study classifies three types of interactions between RGD peptides and the extracellular domains of integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3. Finally, we show that the interaction of the Arg of the RGD sequence may activate integrin via disrupting the key interaction group between K350 on the $\beta$A domain and S673/S674 on the $\beta$TD. {\textcopyright} 2013 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Heterodimeric integrin adhesion receptors regulate diverse biological processes including angiogenesis, thrombosis and wound healing. The transmembrane-cytoplasmic domains (TMCDs) of integrins play a critical role in controlling activation of these receptors via an inside-out signaling mechanism, but the precise structural basis remains elusive. Here, we present the solution structure of integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 TMCD heterodimer, which reveals a right-handed coiled-coil conformation with 2 helices intertwined throughout the transmembrane region. The helices extend into the cytoplasm and form a clasp that differs significantly from a recently published $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 TMCD structure. We show that while a point mutation in the clasp interface modestly activates $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3, additional mutations in the transmembrane interface have a synergistic effect, leading to extensive integrin activation. Detailed analyses and structural comparison with previous studies suggest that extensive integrin activation is a highly concerted conformational transition process, which involves transmembrane coiled-coil unwinding that is triggered by the membrane-mediated alteration and disengagement of the membrane-proximal clasp. Our results provide atomic insight into a type I transmembrane receptor heterocomplex and the mechanism of integrin inside-out transmembrane signaling.},

abstract = {Erudites of the antiquity already knew the calming effect of oil films on the sea waves. But one had to wait until 1774 to read the first scientific report on oil films from B. Franklin and again 1878 to learn the thermodynamic analysis on adsorption developed by J. Gibbs. Then, in 1891, Agnes Pockels described a technique to manipulate oil films by using barriers. Finally, in 1917, I. Langmuir introduced the experimental and theoretical modern concepts on insoluble monolayers. Since that time, and because it has been found to provide invaluable information at the molecular scale, the monolayer technique has been more and more extensively used, and, during the past decade, an explosive increase in the number of publications has occurred. Over the same period, considerable and ever-increasing interest in the antimicrobial peptides of various plants, bacteria, insects, amphibians and mammals has grown. Because many of these antimicrobial peptides act at the cell membrane level, the monolayer technique is entirely suitable for studying their physicochemical and biological properties. This review describes monolayer experiments performed with some of these antimicrobial peptides, especially gramicidin A, melittin, cardiotoxins and defensin A. After giving a few basic notions of surface chemistry, the surface-active properties of these peptides and their behavior when they are arranged in monomolecular films are reported and discussed in relation to their tridimensional structure and their amphipathic character. The penetration of these antimicrobial peptides into phospholipid monolayer model membranes, as well as their interactions with lipids in mixed films, are also emphasized.},

abstract = {Gramicidin A (gA) is a 15-amino-acid antibiotic peptide with an alternating L-D sequence, which forms (dimeric) bilayer-spanning, monovalent cation channels in biological membranes and synthetic bilayers. We performed molecular dynamics simulations of gA dimers and monomers in all-atom, explicit dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC), dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayers. The variation in acyl chain length among these different phospholipids provides a way to alter gA-bilayer interactions by varying the bilayer hydrophobic thickness, and to determine the influence of hydrophobic mismatch on the structure and dynamics of both gA channels (and monomeric subunits) and the host bilayers. The simulations show that the channel structure varied little with changes in hydrophobic mismatch, and that the lipid bilayer adapts to the bilayer-spanning channel to minimize the exposure of hydrophobic residues. The bilayer thickness, however, did not vary monotonically as a function of radial distance from the channel. In all simulations, there was an initial decrease in thickness within 4-5 from the channel, which was followed by an increase in DOPC and POPC or a further decrease in DLPC and DMPC bilayers. The bilayer thickness varied little in the monomer simulations - except one of three independent simulations for DMPC and all three DLPC simulations, where the bilayer thinned to allow a single subunit to form a bilayer-spanning water-permeable pore. The radial dependence of local lipid area and bilayer compressibility is also nonmonotonic in the first shell around gA dimers due to gA-phospholipid interactions and the hydrophobic mismatch. Order parameters, acyl chain dynamics, and diffusion constants also differ between the lipids in the first shell and the bulk. The lipid behaviors in the first shell around gA dimers are more complex than predicted from a simple mismatch model, which has implications for understanding the energetics of membrane protein-lipid interactions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Single-pass membrane receptors contain extracellular domains that respond to external stimuli and transmit information to intracellular domains through a single transmembrane (TM) $\alpha$-helix. Because membrane receptors have various roles in homeostasis, signaling malfunctions of these receptors can cause disease. Despite their importance, there is still much to be understood mechanistically about how single-pass receptors are activated. In general, single-pass receptors respond to extracellular stimuli via alterations in their oligomeric state. The details of this process are still the focus of intense study, and several lines of evidence indicate that the TM domain (TMD) of the receptor plays a central role. We discuss three major mechanistic hypotheses for receptor activation: ligand-induced dimerization, ligand-induced rotation, and receptor clustering. Recent observations suggest that receptors can use a combination of these activation mechanisms and that technical limitations can bias interpretation. Short peptides derived from receptor TMDs, which can be identified by screening or rationally developed on the basis of the structure or sequence of their targets, have provided critical insights into receptor function. Here, we explore recent evidence that, depending on the target receptor, TMD peptides cannot only inhibit but also activate target receptors and can accommodate novel, bifunctional designs. Furthermore, we call for more sharing of negative results to inform the TMD peptide field, which is rapidly transforming into a suite of unique tools with the potential for future therapeutics.},

Here, we report the structure of the integrin $\alpha$IIbΒ3 TM complex, structure-based site-directed mutagenesis and lipid embedding estimates to reveal the structural event that underlies the transition from associated to dissociated states, that is, TM signalling. The complex is stabilized by glycine-packing mediated TM helix crossing within the extracellular membrane leaflet, and by unique hydrophobic and electrostatic bridges in the intracellular leaflet that mediate an unusual, asymmetric association of the 24- and 29-residue $\alpha$IIb and Β3 TM helices.

abstract = {Cytoplasmic face-mediated integrin inside-out activation remains a paradigm in transmembrane signal transduction. Emerging evidence suggests that this process involves dissociation of the complex between the integrin cytoplasmic tails; however, a dynamic image of how it occurs on the membrane surface remains elusive. We show here that, whereas membrane-proximal helices of integrin $\alpha$/$\beta$ cytoplasmic tails associate in cytoplasm-like aqueous medium, they become partially embedded into membrane-mimetic micelles when unclasped. Membrane embedding induces substantial structural changes of the cytoplasmic tails as compared to their aqueous conformations and suggests there may be an upward movement of the membrane-proximal helices into the membrane during their separation. We further demonstrate that the $\beta$3 tail exhibits additional membrane binding site at its C terminus containing the NPLY motif. Talin, a key intracellular integrin activator, recognizes this site as well as the membrane-proximal helix, thereby promoting cytoplasmic tail separation along the membrane surface. These data provide a structural basis of membrane-mediated changes at the cytoplasmic face in regulating integrin activation and signaling.},

abstract = {Integrins are a family of $\alpha$/$\beta$ heterodimeric membrane proteins, which mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. The molecular mechanisms by which integrins are activated and cluster are currently poorly understood. One hypothesis posits that the cytoplasmic tails of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits interact strongly with one another in a 1:1 interaction, and that this interaction is modulated in the course of the activation of $\alpha$∥b$\beta$3 [Hughes, P. E., et al. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 6571-6574]. To examine the structural basis for this interaction, protein fragments encompassing the transmembrane helix plus cytoplasmic tails of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits of $\alpha$∥b$\beta$3 were expressed and studied in phospholipid micelles at physiological salt concentrations. Analyses of these fragments by analytical ultracentrifugation, NMR, circular dichroism, and electrophoresis indicated that they had very little or no tendency to interact with one another. Instead, they formed homomeric interactions, with the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-fragments forming dimers and trimers, respectively. Thus, these regions of the protein structure may contribute to the clustering of integrins that accompanies cellular adhesion.},

abstract = {The interactions between cells and their extracellular matrix (ECM) are critically important for homeostatic control of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Transmembrane integrin molecules facilitate the communication between ECM and the cell. Since the characterization of integrins in the late 1980s, there has been great advancement in understanding the function of integrins at different subcellular levels. However, the versatility in molecular pathways integrins are involved in, the high diversity in their interaction partners both outside and inside the cell as well as on the cell membrane and the short lifetime of events happening at the cell–ECM interface make it difficult to elucidate all the details regarding integrin function experimentally. To overcome the experimental challenges and advance the understanding of integrin biology, computational modeling tools have been used extensively. In this review, we summarize the computational models of integrin signaling while we explain the function of integrins at three main subcellular levels (outside the cell, cell membrane, cytosol). We also discuss how these computational modeling efforts can be helpful in other disciplines such as biomaterial design. As such, this review is a didactic modeling summary for biomaterial researchers interested in complementing their experimental work with computational tools or for seasoned computational scientists that would like to advance current in silico integrin models.},

@article{Brockman1994,
abstract = {Of the individual potentials which comprise the potential profile of a membrane, the least well understood is the dipole potential. In general, the dipole potential is manifested between the hydrocarbon interior of the membrane and the first few water layers adjacent to the lipid head groups. Changes in dipole potential caused by spreading a lipid at an air- or oil-water interface can be measured directly and the dipole potential of bilayers can be estimated from the conductances of hydrophobic ions. For a typical phospholipid, like phosphatidylcholine, its measured value is ∼ 400 mV in monomolecular films and ∼ 280 mV in bilayer membranes, with the hydrocarbon region being positive relative to the aqueous phase. The difference between dipole potentials measured in monolayers and bilayer membranes appears to arise from the use of the lipid-free air- or oil-water interface as the reference point for monolayer measurements and can be corrected for. The species-specific correction term is a lipid concentration-independent potential, the existence of which suggests the ability of lipid headgroups to globally reorganize water structure at the interface. The dipole potential arises from the functional group dipoles of the terminal methyl groups of aliphatic chains, the glycerol-ester region of the lipids and the hydrated polar head groups. Classical methods for obtaining partial dipole moments for each of the three contributing regions are all based on questionable assumptions and give conflicting results. More sophisticated mean-field models of dipole potential origin recognize the important role of interfacial water in determining its value but still cannot adequately describe the microscopic nature of the interactions from which it arises. In part this is because the dipole potential develops in a region over which the dielectric constant of the medium is changing from 2 to 80. Despite of our limited understanding of the dipole potential, it is an important regulator of membrane structure and function. Membrane-membrane and membrane-ligand interactions are regulated by the hydration force, the value of which can be related to the dipole potential of the membrane. For thermotropically phase-separated or multicomponent membranes the size and shape of lipid domains is controlled by the balance between the line tension at the domain borders and the difference in dipole density between the domains. Line tension tends to make the domains compact and circular whereas dipole repulsion promotes transitions to complex domain shapes with larger perimeters. The role in enzyme regulation of mean interfacial dipole potential and differences in its lateral distribution is a promising area for future investigation and will contribute to our understanding of lipid-mediated cellular signaling in cells. An important tool in these investigations and in better understanding the origins of the dipole potential on a microscopic level will be the recently-developed Maxwell stress microscope. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {Micropipette measurements of isotropic tension vs. area expansion in pre-swollen single human red cells gave a value of 288 +/- 50 SD dyn/cm for the elastic, area compressibility modulus of the total membrane at 25 degrees C. This elastic constant, characterizing the resistance to area expansion or compression, is about 4 X 10(4) times greater than the elastic modulus for shear rigidity; therefore, in situations where deformation of the membrane does not require large isotropic tensions (e.g., in passage through normal capillaries), the membrane can be treated by a simple constitutive relation for a two-dimensionally, incompressible material (i.e. fixed area). The tension was found to be linear and reversible for the range of area changes observed (within the experimental system resolution of 10{\%}). The maximum fractional area expansion required to produce lysis was uniformly distributed between 2 and 4{\%} with 3{\%} average and 0.7{\%} SD. By heating the cells to 50 degrees C, it appears that the structural matrix (responsible for the shear rigidity and most of the strength in isotropic tension) is disrupted and primarily the lipid bilayer resists lysis. Therefore, the relative contributions of the structural matrix and lipid bilayer to the elastic, area compressibility could be estimated. The maximum isotropic tension at 25 degrees C is 10–12 dyn/cm and at 50 degrees C is between 3 and 4 dyn/cm. From this data, the respective compressibilities are estimated at 193 dyn/cm and 95 dyn/cm for structural network and bilayer. The latter value correlates well with data on in vitro, monolayer surface pressure versus area curves at oil-water interfaces. {\textcopyright} 1976, The Biophysical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We quantify directly here for the first time the extents of interactions of two different anthracycline drugs with pure and mixed lipid monolayers with respect to the surface pressure and elucidate differences in the resulting interaction mechanisms. The work concerns interactions of doxorubicin (DOx) and idarubicin (IDA) with monolayers of the zwitterionic DMPC (1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and negatively charged DMPS (1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (sodium salt)) as well as a 7:3 mixture of the two lipids. These drugs are used in current cancer treatments, while the lipid systems were chosen as phosphocholines are the major lipid component of healthy cell membranes, and phosphoserines are the major lipid component that is externalized into the outer leaflet of cancerous cell membranes. It is shown that DOx interacts with DMPS monolayers to a greater extent than with DMPC monolayers by lower limits of a factor of 5 at a surface pressure of 10 mN/m and a factor of 12 at 30 mN/m. With increasing surface pressure, the small amount of drug ({\~{}}0.3 µmol/m2) bound to DMPC monolayers is excluded from the interface, yet its interaction with DMPS monolayers is enhanced until there is even more drug ({\~{}}3.2 µmol/m2) than lipid ({\~{}}2.6 µmol/m2) at the interface. Direct evidence is presented for all systems studied that upon surface area compression lipid is reproducibly expelled from the monolayer, which we infer to be in the form of drug-lipid aggregates, yet the nature of adsorption of material back to the monolayer upon expansion is system-dependent. At 30 mN/m, most relevant to human physiology, the interactions of DOx and IDA are starkly different. For DOx, there is a conformational change in the interfacial layer driven by aggregation, resulting in the formation of lateral domains that have extended layers of drug. For the more lipophilic IDA, there is penetration of the drug into the hydrophobic acyl chain region of the monolayer and no indication of lateral segregation. In addition to the Langmuir technique, these advances were made as a result of direct measurements of the interfacial composition, structure and morphology using two different implementations of neutron reflectometry and Brewster angle microscopy. The results provide new insight into key processes that determine the uptake of drugs such as limited drug penetration through cell membranes by passive diffusion as well as activation of drug removal mechanisms related to multidrug resistance.},

abstract = {The surface of a pharmaceutical solid has a direct implication on a wide range interfacial phenomena affecting powder processing, handling, and performance. This chapter employs a first principles approach to unravel the effects of interfaces in solid-state pharmaceuticals. The interfaces encountered in pharmaceutical development are addressed first. Then, the fundamental intermolecular forces are presented, along with the thermodynamics of interfacial phenomena. The macroscopic manifestation of these fundamentals in the context of the different interfaces accompanying them with relevant applications from the field of solid dosage forms is then presented. It should be highlighted that the effects of interfacial phenomena should not be examined isolated from the bulk properties of the material and the environmental conditions. The overall properties of the materials have contributions from both bulk and interfacial components. The significance of the contributions from the interfacial component hinges on the surface-to-volume ratio of the system.},

abstract = {Integrin cell-adhesion receptors transduce signals bidirectionally across the plasma membrane via the single-pass transmembrane segments of each $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunit. While the $\beta$3 transmembrane segment consists of a linear 29-residue $\alpha$-helix, the structure of the $\alpha$IIb transmembrane segment reveals a linear 24-residue $\alpha$-helix (Ile-966-Lys-989) followed by a backbone reversal that packs Phe-992-Phe-993 against the transmembrane helix. The length of the $\alpha$IIb transmembrane helix implies the absence of a significant transmembrane helix tilt in contrast to its partnering $\beta$3 subunit. Sequence alignment shows Gly-991-Phe-993 to be fully conserved among all 18 human integrin $\alpha$ subunits, suggesting that their unusual structural motif is prototypical for integrin $\alpha$ subunits. The $\alpha$IIb transmembrane structure demonstrates a level of complexity within the membrane that is beyond simple transmembrane helices and forms the structural basis for assessing the extent of structural and topological rearrangements upon $\alpha$IIb-$\beta$3 association, i.e. integrin transmembrane signaling. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

@article{Toimil2012,
abstract = {In this work the interaction between human serum albumin (HSA) and a monofluorinated phospholipid, 1-palmitoyl-2-[16-fluoropalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine] (F-DPPC), was studied by using Langmuir monolayer and Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) techniques. Different amounts of F-DPPC were spread on a previously formed HSA monolayer located at the air/water interface at 25°C and the mixed monolayers thus obtained showed the existence of a liquid expanded-liquid condensed (LE-LC) phase transition (at 14mN/m), attributed to the pure F-DPPC monolayer, coexisting with a second transition (at 22-24mN/m) corresponding to the protein conformational change from an unfolded state to another in " loops" configuration. Relative thickness measurements recorded during the compression of the mixed monolayers showed the existence of an " exclusion" surface pressure ($\pi$exc), above which the protein is squeezed out the interface, but not totally. BAM images reveal that some protein molecules in a packed " loops" configuration remain at the interface at surface pressures higher than the " exclusion" surface pressure. The application of the Defay-Crisp phase rule to the phase diagram of the F-DPPC/HSA system can explain the existence of certain regions of surface pressure in which the mixed monolayer components are miscible, as well as those others that they are immiscible. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},
